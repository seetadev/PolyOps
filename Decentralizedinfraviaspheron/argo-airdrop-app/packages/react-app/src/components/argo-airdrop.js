              The internet has been around for some time now. However, much of
              its fluid nature is now controlled and censored by governments and
              corporates. But nowadays the internet is in the middle of a
              revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced
              with decentralized solutions and monolithic services replaced with
              peer-to-peer algorithmic systems. Here comes the Decentralized
              Hosting solution, which can revolutionize how traditional web
              hosting services work. With peer-to-peer content delivery
              networks, hosting a web application now can be easily done without
              a centralized system. With the advent of Web3.0 technologies, it
              is now more than ever important to decentralize frontend
              applications without a centralized entity controlling their hosted
              site and takedown at any moment.

              ArGo provides a User Interface for any deployment on Arweave
              Protocol and simplifies the experience of developers to work on
              Arweave Protocol and focus on only building applications. ArGo
              provides persistent logs monitoring for deployments and helps in
              organizing their deployments on Arweave with GitHub-based
              organizations and repositories like structure. ArGo also provides
              DNS configuration for any deployment with an intuitive User
              Experience. With ArGo, users no longer have to depend on
              subscription plans of cloud provider giants, enjoy fast deployment
              via pre-rendered front-end web pages supported by multiple
              Jamstacks, and scale seamlessly without any monthly recurring
              fees. This space is 100% auditable and verifiable because all the
              deployment will be logged in the blockchain with tags to
              distinguish them.
