  under the guidance of Manusheel Gupta. 

2.0 - October 25 2009
* Optimization of the save files. The sheet extents are more likely to include just the part that has data. 
  Previously there were cases where deleted cells made the program think the sheet was larger than it really was. 
  It also "canonicalizes" the saved data in other ways, such as removing no longer used formats and color definitions from the save file. 
  Some input forms, such as "-", that were incorrectly treated as numbers, are now treated as text. Some other minor bugs were fixed. 
* Localization made easy, especially of text in the user interface. 
  All of the text that is normally seen during operation should now be easily localizable by changing a single file, socialcalcconstants.js.
