# PolyOps
Enable effective management and communication setup for Drones utilized in Construction, Logistics, Operations, Remote Water Monitoring, Sewage Management, Quality Assurance and Recyclability of Water in rivers.


Platform Features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.

We utilize the SAP UI5, Fiori platform, Polygon blockchain, IPFS/Filecoin via NFT.Storage, Chainlink, Spheron infrastructure and Fluence peer protocol, OVIX lending/claim, Sequence wallet with QuickSwap protocol to built the platform solution. We also utilized Ethereum blockchain for developing a decentralized rating and review system for drones used by real estate developers and building infrastructure service providers.

Our platform solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of drone cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Our platform will provide the requisites features to share security conditions and remotely monitor the management policies in a place using used and broken phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the businesses living in a variety of geographical regions. We also utilized google spreadsheets and its apis, google map APIs and telegram bot for developing monitoring and management application.
