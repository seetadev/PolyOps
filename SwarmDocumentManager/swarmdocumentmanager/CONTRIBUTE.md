# Contributing Guidelines

*  Bug fixes
    -  If you find a bug, please first report it using GitHub issues.
    -  If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, create a Pull Request from your own fork and mention the issue number.
        +  Include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed.
*  New Features
    -  Describe the problem/feature request in a new GitHub issue.
*  Tests, Documentation, Miscellaneous
    -  If it's a trivial change, go ahead and create a Pull Request with the changes you have in mind
    -  If not, open a GitHub issue to discuss the idea first.

## Requirements

For a contribution to be accepted:

*  The test suite must be complete and pass
*  Code must follow existing styling conventions
*  Commit messages must be descriptive. Related issues should be mentioned by number.

If the contribution doesn't meet these criteria, a maintainer will discuss with you on the issue. You can still
continue to add more commits to the branch you have sent the Pull Request from.

## How To Start

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
1. Clone/fetch your fork to your local development machine.
1. Create a new branch (e.g. `issue-12`, `feat.add_foo`, etc) and check it out.
1. Make your changes and commit them. (Did the tests pass?)
1. Push your new branch to your fork. (e.g. `git push myname issue-12`)
1. Open a Pull Request from your new branch to the original fork's `master` branch.
